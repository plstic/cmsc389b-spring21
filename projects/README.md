# Projects

Project instructions and links.

## Environment setup

We utilize Docker to set up a virtual machine.
Our Docker image includes all necessary interpreters, compilers, and anything else you need to _run_ your code.
See [our Docker directory](../docker/) for setup instructions.

## Development setup

This part is **up to you**.
We have _recommendations_, but you can use whatever you like to actually _write_ your code.

(list main editor recommendation, etc...)

## Project retrieval and submission

Projects should be cloned from our GitHub Classroom.
Submission is simple -- push your code solution to your cloned repository before the due-date!
TODO : we may change this to Gradescope submissions.
