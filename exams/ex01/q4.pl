% n - the number of values to take from the recursive sequence
% s - the sum of the first n values from the recursive sequence
% a - the value of a(1)
% b - the value of a(2)
% c - the coefficient of the a_{n-1} term on the linear combination
% d - the coefficient of the a_{n-2} term of the linear combination
sequence(n,s,a,b,c,d) :- % your code here

% sequence(3,4,1,1,1,1) should be true
